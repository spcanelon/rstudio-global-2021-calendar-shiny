2005,Everything everywhere all at once: Data from around the world to report on global issues,"In an interconnected world, data is more accessible than ever—but finding and using global data comes with unique challenges. In this panel, reporters will explore strategies for locating reliable international datasets and navigating the obstacles that come with using them. From language barriers to currency conversions, inconsistent formats, and varying levels of data transparency, journalists must adapt to diverse contexts to uncover the story within the data. Panelists will share practical solutions for addressing these challenges, including best practices for working with multilingual datasets, standardizing metrics across borders, and verifying sources in regions with limited transparency. Additionally, the session will tackle the complex issue of obtaining documents and records in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent. Panelists will highlight creative approaches to accessing critical information, from building local partnerships to leveraging non-traditional sources.
Key questions for discussion during the panel:
- What are the most effective methods for identifying and accessing reliable global data sources?
- What unique challenges do international datasets present—such as language barriers, currency discrepancies, or incompatible formats—and what strategies can help overcome them?
- How can journalists access critical documents in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent?",Panel,2025-03-06T15:00:00Z,2025-03-06T16:00:00Z,60,1h,,,,Thursday,Yes,"Helena Bengtsson - Gota Media, Irene Casado Sanchez - Big Local News, Eva Constantaras - Lighthouse Reports, Andy Lehren - The Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism | CUNY JSchool, Bianca  Muniz - Agência Pública de Jornalismo Investigativo","Grand Portage Ballroom 3, fourth floor",https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html#2005,

1089,Get AI to read all that stuff with semantic search,"Semantic search is a novel way to search large sets of short-ish text, like datasets of complaints, incident reports or social media posts. Instead of keyword search – which misses misspellings, paraphrase and use of terms that the user hasn't thought of  – semantic search finds results whose meaning is similar to that of the query.

It's a guaranteed-safe way to use AI in a newsroom context, because the only downside of a ""false positive"" match is wasting the reporter's time in reading the irrelevant search results.

1113,Reporting on America's prison and jail death crisis,"It’s been a decade since Congress passed the Deaths in Custody Reporting Act, but the federal government still doesn’t know how many people die in jails or prisons or during arrests. Even worse, it has since told the inspector general that it has “no plans” of releasing the data it has already collected and is currently battling with USA Today and the Appeal in separate lawsuits, each seeking the data that the federal government has collected under DCRA.

But where do you start now? The lack of direction from the federal government means that each state handles this data differently. Different agencies collect different pieces of the data, and you’ll have to string it together yourself. In this panel, reporters who’ve done the hard work of piecing deaths in custody data together will walk you through how you can build your own database to hold jails, prisons and police agencies accountable.",Panel,2025-03-07T15:00:00Z,2025-03-07T16:00:00Z,60,1h,,,,Friday,Yes,"Ethan Corey - The Appeal, A.J.

1147,How to investigate special-interest influence on your Congressional delegation,"Two decades after an embarrassing ethics scandal forced the U.S. Congress to revamp its disclosure requirements for members accepting private trips from special interest groups, those organizations have blown a hole through those rules. An investigation by veteran IRE members and their student teams at The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland and Boston University reveals, for the first time, how special interests paying for House members and their staff to travel around the world are skirting requirements limiting the access lobbyists involved in the trips have to House members.  The reporters examined 17,000 trips since 2012, also showing how 24 House members turned scores of trips into “influence peddling vacations” for themselves and their relatives. The team’s work led to a series of national investigative stories published in September 2024 with more on deck this year. You will leave this session ready to mine congressional private travel records and deeply probe special interest influence on House members in your state.",Panel,2025-03-08T15:00:00Z,2025-03-08T16:00:00Z,60,1h,,,,Saturday,Yes,"Maggie Mulvihill - Boston University, Derek Willis - University of Maryland","Grand Portage Ballroom 4, fourth floor",https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html#1147,

3001,"Layer Cake: How to build reusable, customizable graphics with D3 and Svelte","Working on deadline, news graphics need to be made quickly. They also often require customization to meet the needs of the day's story accurately and cleanly. These two requirements are often at odds with one another. Graphics libraries that let you make charts quickly are often not customizable. The most customizable graphics framework, D3, often requires a great deal of prep and code to even make a simple bar chart.

In this presentation, we'll look at Layer Cake, which is a graphics framework in Svelte built for these twin demands of a newsroom. Its approach is different from most frameworks or libraries you may have worked with and we'll look at how you can create reusable code to  produce engaging graphics in a fast-paced environment.

This session is good for people who have knowledge of JavaScript and D3 already and want to learn how to translate that to Svelte. Experience with Svelte is not required but will be helpful. We'll discuss the philosophy behind project code as much as possible. Attendees will need to bring their own laptop (no tablets) for the training.",Hands-on,2025-03-07T16:15:00Z,2025-03-07T17:15:00Z,60,1h,,,Advanced,Friday,No,Michael Keller - The New York Times,"Gray's Bay, eighth floor",https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html#3001,
